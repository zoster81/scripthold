# Scripthold Development Roadmap

This file tracks **current and future work only**. Completed changes belong in [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md); current behavior and invariants belong in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md), [`TOOLS.md`](../TOOLS.md), and the focused operational guides.

## Current state

- Current public release: **Scripthold 3.3.6**, published through the protected immutable GitHub release process.
- Current public capabilities: **43 tools**, **3 guided prompts**, **168 registered text encodings**, and **100 active source-intelligence providers**.
- Completed work is summarized in [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) and implemented history remains in Git.
- No active release-scoped milestone is currently approved. Publication and private deployment remain separate actions; release 3.3.6 does not automatically upgrade existing installations.

## Planning rules

- At most one release-scoped milestone may be active at a time.
- Define the user-visible outcome, compatibility boundary, security impact, and completion gate before implementation.
- Preserve current filesystem, encoding, mutation, backup, execution, transport, and source-intelligence boundaries unless a milestone explicitly changes them.
- Keep public MCP concepts compact and difficult to misuse.
- Require an exact clean commit and the release procedure in [`PUBLISHING.md`](PUBLISHING.md) for public release authority.
- Do not accumulate implementation diaries or per-phase evidence in this file.

## Release engineering

The active publication flow is a protected, draft-first, single-writer pipeline. It authenticates and publishes the complete 22-asset set as an immutable GitHub Release before publishing matching MCPB metadata to the MCP Registry. Its first end-to-end public qualification was **v3.3.3**; ongoing release requirements and recovery safeguards are documented in [PUBLISHING.md](PUBLISHING.md). Version-specific completed work belongs in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).

## Reserved 4.0 boundary

Version 4.0 is reserved for a deliberately reviewed major compatibility or capability boundary after the 3.x work. Its scope is not frozen.

Automatic project-wide semantic refactoring remains out of scope unless maintainers explicitly reopen that decision.

Research topics such as visual desktop interaction or MCP federation are not approved milestones or APIs. They require separate product, architecture, privacy, security, and UX review before implementation.
